# Formula one Grand Prix
## Problem Statement
In the Indian Grand Prix, drivers compete to have the highest visibility, which is determined by the number of drivers they can see in front of them and behind them. The challenge is to find the driver with the maximum visibility based on the heights of the drivers.

According to the new set of rules for Indian Grand Prix, each driver will be given a vehicle with different height and the driver with maximum VISIBILITY would win the race.
Now, VISIBILITY of a driver is defined by (X times P), where
X = number of drivers he can see in front of him number of drivers he can see behind him
P = position of the driver in a given scenario (index of the driver array is 1-N indexed)
As all the drivers are moving in a straight line, a driver i cannot see beyond another driver | if height of j>-height of driver i
